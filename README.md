# Attendance-Manager
    Developed an application for maintenance of Leave and On-Duty using MongoDB and Node.js. Faculty and students are facilitated with our application.  Students are allowed to apply leave and on-duty via forms and send it to their respective tutors and view their status of response from the corresponding faculty. The staffs are allowed to view their wards attendance and grant them permission or reject them or forward it to higher designated staffs .
